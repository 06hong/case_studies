Huron is a very professional company and that showed during interview process. I had an initial phone screen with a recruiter and two more phone interviews with Directors. I was invited to headquarters for a full day of interviewing. Four in-person interviews with questions that were most behavioral. Be prepared with multiple answers for standard questions like greatest accomplishments, difficult situations, etc. Do a search online for consulting interview questions and you should be fine. Be sure to know your resume and be prepared with questions to ask your interviewer. The case was very straight forward and you have plenty of time to work on it. Luckily, my case dealt with the specific field the position was in.
