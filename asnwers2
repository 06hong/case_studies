Your hospital is $1 million over budget. Solve how and give a recommendation on how to improve it.

           The root of this issue is to find out what are exactly causing the over budget, so:
I would go to the accounting department, ask for the manager and ask for an open source accounting on what is included in the budget 
Then, we would had a discussion together and make a list on what is essential for the hospital, and what is not essential on that list
If the budget includes opening a fancy restaurant with quality food, we can eliminate the whole entire restaurant, or find ways to eliminate the number of chairs, desk etc depending on how much we can saved
If the budget includes some essentials such as equipment and hospital beds, I will ask the manager which brand he/she is choosing the equipment from, and how we can search for an alternative brand that provides equal efficiency for a more affordable price by researching other hospital.

Break down the budget to see where the money allocated into and what is included in the budget. and cut costs that are non-essential (disregard the fancy caterfia that need to be built)




Walk me through the steps of reducing wait times for emergency rooms in hospitals.
Find the root cause of wait time, usually it is because limited number of ER available and large number of patients
So Allocate the beds from resting patients to patients in need. Some resting patients take extensive recovery days, they can allocate those bed days for the ones who need it more.



Tell me about a time when you solved a difficult problem, the steps you went about solving it, and what the result was.
911 call at emergency center


At time when you worked with a difficult person and how did you deal with it
Take about the newly pregnant dad
Difficult not as in behavioral, but lacking in effort
I was the team leader and one teammate did not participate in meetings, handing in works
We spoke he told me he new dad but too embarrassed to let everyone know//
