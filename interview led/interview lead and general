Case interview: very different from what you would prepare for McKinsey..Bain..etc. It is interviewer-led and the questions are very general. 
First two questions are about why this happened with this client and what is your solution..then the third question interviewer asked me to make a recommendation to upper level management ASSUMING that I have all my data and research done. 
There is a math problem following the case interview as well. Very simple.
