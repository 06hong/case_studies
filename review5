1. 15 minute Phone screening with recruiter: brief run through of who you are and who the recruiter is.
2. 45 minute behavior interview with director: fairly simple. Make sure you have stories to show times when you experienced certain situations. Look up examples of behavioral fit questions.
3. Case interview with Sr. Director: case wasn't difficult, but different that typical cases; there was much less math involved and very little information that you had to ask for. They want to see what you value to be important in a real-world example. Don't be afraid to ask to hear it one more time.
4. Final round interview at HQ: Panel Lunch with Analysts, followed by two separate 40 minute interviews with a Director and an Associate. Ask questions and be engaging with the analysts at lunch. Come prepared with questions about the position. Go over Huron's values, as well as behavioral fit questions.
